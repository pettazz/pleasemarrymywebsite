DRAFTING
- One Pre-Episode, One Post-Exits, One Post-Episode.
- Each contestant can be on the same team twice.
- No two teams within a league can be the same.
- If a contestant gets sent home, you can replace them.
- If multiple teams have to re-draft, the team with the fewest total points drafts first.
- From Ep. 2 on, the Team in Last Place has the option to switch a contestant out between episodes, without them having to be kicked off.

Once there are not enough contestants to draft a new one post-rose ceremony without adhering to rules 2 and 3, everyone drops down to 2. At Hometowns, drop down to 1.
